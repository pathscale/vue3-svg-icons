I'd include google/material-design-icons, but uncertain how it differs siginificantly from the other icon sets already included as well as their abuse and extreme love for directories. If they just dumped everything in an svg/ dir with logical naming it would be ok, but for some reason...... naming an svg file 24px.svg is kinda nonsense to me, but hey.. these are the same guys working on angular
